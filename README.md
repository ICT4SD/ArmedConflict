Deliverable 2 : Political and humanitarian trends regarding Lebanon
-------------

In the context of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), in light of the ten year mark this year. 

The aim of that exercise would be to quantify if relative calm prevails in the South of Lebanon following the 2006 war, while growing humanitarian and development needs exists throughout the country in light of the armed conflict in Syria next door.

This analysis migt be possible based on the openly available Report of the Secretary-General on Security Council resolution 1701  (e.g. Blue Line violations, terrorism incidents, number of refugees from Syria, Palestinian refugees, volume of humanitarian aid, etc.), RBB reports (National Dialogue sessions, etc.) and UNDAFs/LCRPs (see below). 

Expected outputs: 
- A clean data spreadsheet and statistics summary
- A dashboard to visualise trends
